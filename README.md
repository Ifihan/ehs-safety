# Object Detection of EHS equipments with YOLO

## Introduction

This project is about object detection of EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) equipments with YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The project is implemented with Python and YOLO.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```bash

cd ehs-safety
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your environment variables:

- Create a .env file based on the .env.example file.
- Add your secret keys and other configuration information.
